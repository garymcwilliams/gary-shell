This is the Changelog for Vim Intellisense

Version 1.4.1
-------------
intellisense,txt
	* updated to reflect changes in installation and version

intellisense.vim
	* If the VIM_INTELLISENSE variable was not set, intellisense.vim is
	  meant to try and define it if at all possible.  There was a bug in how
	  this was done which meant it failed miserably.
	* Made the error and warning functions global so the ftplugin .vim files
	  could call the functions to report to the user

C++ Plugin
	VimHelper.pm
		* bug in setting the path for ctags when using ActivePerl prevented
		  ctags from being executed

Developer
	* some test data for the c++ testsuite had not been placed into the CVS.
	  It is now in the CVS.
	* released source using RELEASE_1_4_1 tag

Known Bugs
	* Developers are unable to use Visual Studio 7 to compile insenvim.exe.
	  The exe produces runtime errors.

Version 1.4
-----------
Installer
    * modified to take into account a %HOME%/vimfiles as a possible location
      for the ftplugin and plugin directories.

Menu Added
    * There is now an Intellisense menu with one item, Show Configuration.  So
      at the very least you know your plugin directory is sourced or not.

C++ Plugin
    Startup Defaults
        * Show public access types only
        * use vimpath not just INCLUDE for generating ctags

    Menu System
        * Show current settings for c++ intellisense
        * Some toggle options to change the behaviour of intellisense
        * Allow the user to view any intellisense generated files in %TEMP%

    Backend
        * created a perl test framework
        * ported and refactored code so it now works with Cygwin perl as well
          as ActivePerl
        * Fixed bug in backend where access to variables/functions were allways
          considered public 
        * Fixed bug with namespaced classes not being detected correctly
        * Added more logging

    Plugin/FtPlugin
        * added error checking so intellisense does not fail silently
        * fixed some guards so the files are not loaded more than once

Developers
    Added Source to CVS
        * Initialised CVS with version 1.3 of the source code
        * Applied tag RELEASE_1_3 to cvs
        * released version 1.4 under RELEASE_1_4 tag
        * Created .sln files for visual studio 7 compilation
        * Converted mkinsen.bat to perl code, now supports vs 7
