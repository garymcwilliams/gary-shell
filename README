Shell type setup, mostly geared around cygwin & work

As it's shell type, the line endings need to be LF, so this needs to be set (especially on Cygwin on Windows)

git config core.autocrlf input

If you have already checked out files on cygwin and find that the line endings are already wrong, then you need to fix them (after setting the autocrlf):

git ls-files -z | xargs -0 rm
git checkout .
